# cub3d

Cub3D is a 3D graphics programming project assigned to students at 42, a coding school. It involves building a basic game engine using the ray-casting technique to render a maze-like game world in a 2D window. The game world can be loaded from a file and players can move around the world. The project also involves implementing textures and sprite animation, as well as collision detection. The project is completed in the C programming language using the minilibx library for graphics rendering.
To try it download and install [minilibx-linux](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) in a minilibx-linux folder in the root directory of this repository.
